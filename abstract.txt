Dissolved organic carbon and dissolved total nitrogen are measured from discrete bottle samples collected during CTD-rosette casts on Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) Transect cruises (ongoing since 2022). Sampling frequency is approximately seasonal. Sample collection is paired with particulate organic carbon at surface, subsurface chlorophyll max, and sometimes a third depth. Samples are filtered directly from the CTD rosette and acidified in the field, then analyzed using a Shimadzu TOC-LCPH total organic carbon analyzer coupled to a TNM-L analyzer for total nitrogen. Values are reported in micromoles per liter.
